# MP5_Spark
Spark with MLLib, GraphFrames

Before Implement Spark code: Install Spark version 2.4 into the Docker


Part A

Create vertices dataframe, Create edges dataframe

get_connected_components is given a graphframe that represents the given graph

Part B

Using PySpark mllib to run a KMeans Model

Part C

Create dataframe for vertices, Create dataframe for edges

Find shortest distances in the given graphframe to the vertex which has id `dst_id`

Part D

Train random forest classifier from given data

Result should be an RDD with the prediction of the random forest
